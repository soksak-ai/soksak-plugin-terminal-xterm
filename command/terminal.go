// Package command routes the terminal command group to whoever owns the PTY.

// It opens no pseudo-terminal, reads no bytes, and reaps no process. The kernel
// object, the read loop and the process-group kill belong to whoever holds the
// file descriptor; this package holds the command names, the identity table
// that pairs a caller's id with an owner's handle, and the rules about what may
// be asked.
//
// Why routing rather than a second implementation: a command registers once and
// is reached through every transport, and nothing may bypass the registry — a
// second path drifts from the first, and the drift stays quiet until the two
// give different answers. Two terminal paths would be exactly that. The owner
// arrives through the interfaces declared below, so this package names no
// vendor and answers identically in a window, in a headless server, and in a
// test.
//
// Backpressure is deliberately absent here, and that is a gap rather than a
// design: see the reason attached to ack_terminal.

// Handles rather than ids cross it: a stale handle fails against the owner's
// generation check instead of landing in the session that replaced it.
//
// The key names the session, and it is the only thing about the caller's pane
// the owner receives. It is read by splitting it on "/": two fields are
// (windowLabel, paneId) and three are a session the caller gave no pane id,
// whose window half is still the first field. Neither half of a pair may
// contain the separator, so the two shapes cannot be confused. That grammar is
// written here because an owner needs the pair back. The pair is injected into
// the shell as SOKSAK_WINDOW and SOKSAK_CALLER_TAB, which is how a tool
// running inside a pane names the pane it is running in; an owner handed one
// opaque string could only guess at it.
//
// Opening over a key that already holds a live session replaces it, and the
// owner closes the one it replaced. This package drops the replaced id in the
// same step and then holds no other way to reach that shell, so an owner that
// keeps both leaks the first one with nothing left to close it by.
