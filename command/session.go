// Session identity: what a caller holds, what the owner holds, and how the two
// are matched.
//
// The caller holds a uint32 id minted here from 1. The owner holds a Handle,
// which is a key plus the generation the owner stamped on it. Nothing about a
// PTY is in this file — the kernel object, the read loop, and the reaping are
// the file descriptor holder's.

// separator joins the two halves of a reattach key.

// Handle is the owner's name for a live session, and the coordinate the output
// event returns. A caller matches bytes to a pane by it.

// Generation is what makes a stale handle fail instead of landing in the
// replacement: the owner mints a new one on every open, so a handle held across
// a respawn no longer matches the session sitting under its key.

// reattach that crosses windows is a session drawn in the wrong place, and only
// the window half of the key can refuse it.
//
// An absent window label arrives as "" and derives the same key an explicit ""
// would. The frontend collapses the two before they leave it
// (`currentWindowLabel() || null`), so telling them apart here would invent a
// second key for one window rather than describe a difference that exists.
