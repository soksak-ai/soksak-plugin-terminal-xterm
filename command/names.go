package command

// CommandNames is every command this group owns, served or not.
//
// A process with no session owner registers none of them, and the difference
// between "this build has no terminals" and "this build forgot a command" is
// only visible if the names are still declared. So the composition root needs
// them without constructing the group.
//
// TestTheNameListMatchesWhatRegisterTouches holds this equal to what Register
// actually does with an owner present.
